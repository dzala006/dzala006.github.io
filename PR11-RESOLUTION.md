# Resolution for PR #11 Merge Conflicts

## Issue

PR #11 is attempting to create new files that already exist in the repository, including:
1. A new `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` file
2. A new `README.md` file with notification system documentation

## Solution

The existing files already include the notification system integration:
1. The existing `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` already includes notification integration
2. The existing `HomeScreen.js` already includes notification integration
3. The `notifications.js` utility file already exists and is being used by these components

## How to Proceed

1. Close PR #11 as it's redundant with existing code
2. Continue with merging the other PRs that depend on the existing notification system

This will resolve the merge conflicts and allow the project to move forward.

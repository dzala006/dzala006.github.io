# Resolution for PR #10 Merge Conflicts

## Issue

PR #10 is attempting to create a new `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` file, but there's already an existing file with that name in the repository that has more advanced functionality.

## Solution

The existing `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` already includes:
1. Notification system integration
2. Partner selection and preference merging
3. Collaborative itinerary generation
4. Proper error handling and UI components

## How to Proceed

1. Close PR #10 as it's redundant with existing code
2. Continue with merging the other PRs that depend on the existing `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` file

This will resolve the merge conflicts and allow the project to move forward.

# Resolution for PR #8 Merge Conflicts

## Issue

PR #8 is attempting to create a new `HomeScreen.js` file to integrate the FeedbackPopup component, but there's already an existing `HomeScreen.js` file in the repository that has more advanced functionality.

## Solution

The existing `HomeScreen.js` already includes:
1. FeedbackPopup integration
2. Notification system integration
3. Time-based greetings
4. Feedback collection with proper timing
5. Itinerary regeneration based on feedback

## How to Proceed

1. Close PR #8 as it's redundant with existing code
2. Continue with merging the other PRs that depend on the existing `HomeScreen.js` file

This will resolve the merge conflicts and allow the project to move forward.

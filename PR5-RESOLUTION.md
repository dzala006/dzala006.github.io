# Resolution for PR #5 Merge Conflicts

## Issue

PR #5 is attempting to create a new itineraryController.js file that imports the autoReservationFallback function from reservationAI.js, but there's an issue with the import statement.

## Solution

The import statement in itineraryController.js should be:

```javascript
const { autoReservationFallback } = require('../utils/reservationAI');
```

This ensures that the function is properly imported from the reservationAI.js utility file.

## How to Proceed

1. Update the import statement in itineraryController.js
2. Merge PR #5 with the corrected import

This will resolve the merge conflicts and allow the project to move forward.

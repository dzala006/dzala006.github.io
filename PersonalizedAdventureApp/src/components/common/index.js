/**
 * Common Components Index
 * 
 * This file exports all common UI components to make imports cleaner.
 * Instead of importing each component individually, you can import multiple
 * components from this single file.
 * 
 * Example:
 * import { Button, Card, Typography, Container } from '../components/common';
 */

import Button from './Button';
import Card from './Card';
import Typography from './Typography';
import Container from './Container';

export {
  Button,
  Card,
  Typography,
  Container
};

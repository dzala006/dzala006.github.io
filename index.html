        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Analyst</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Darshansinh Zala is an ambitious first-year student at the University of California, Riverside, with sophomore standing, majoring in Business Economics and aspiring to transfer to UCLA as a Political Science major. With a profound interest in leadership and a natural aptitude for public service, Darshansinh has been actively involved in several impactful initiatives, showcasing his commitment to advocacy and community engagement. Notably, he was the youngest board member of the BAPS Public Affairs team, where he served as the main point of contact with State Senator Sydney Kamlager's office during the 2021 fireworks explosion, orchestrating relief efforts that relocated hundreds within 24 hours. His deep sense of responsibility and his alignment with his cultural values are evident, as he frequently emphasizes the importance of helping people and credits his religion as a significant influence on his life. His early involvement with Choice International and later position as its Procurement VP have further strengthened his capabilities in both strategic thinking and operational management.<br><br>

        Beyond his academic and professional achievements, Darshansinh is deeply passionate about building and enhancing his skill set through diverse extracurricular activities. He is currently involved in several organizations at UCR, including Riverside Dragon Boat, Men's Volleyball Club, and Model UN. Darshansinh has also recently taken an interest in sports management, applying to become a student manager for the UCR men's basketball team. His athletic background in varsity football, volleyball, and dragon boat has instilled a strong work ethic and dedication, which he now channels into both his studies and his roles in student organizations. Furthermore, his hands-on experience managing multiple hotels for his family has not only honed his leadership and operational skills but has also deepened his financial acumen, empowering him to contribute meaningfully to his family's legacy.<br><br>

        Darshansinh’s professional ambitions align with his interest in governance and policy, demonstrated by his recent application to the UCSA Government Relations Policy Fellowship. His acceptance into the UCDC program for the upcoming spring quarter also highlights his intent to gain exposure to real-world policy-making environments. In pursuit of this goal, Darshansinh has applied to the South Asian Federation at UCR for either the Finance Intern or Advocacy/Philanthropy Intern position, intending to further develop his expertise in finance and community outreach. With his sights set on a concurrent degree in Political Science and International Affairs, he hopes to leverage these opportunities to make a lasting impact on policies that address underrepresented communities. Darshansinh's dedication to his field and his drive to excel continue to propel him forward as he builds a future focused on advocacy, economic empowerment, and public service.

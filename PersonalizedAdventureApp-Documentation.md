# Personalized Adventure App - Integration Summary & Documentation

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### Backend (Node.js/Express with MongoDB)

The backend is structured as a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

```

```

## 2. User Management System

### Registration & Login

The user management system handles authentication and profile management:

1. **Registration Process**:
   - Users register via the `RegisterScreen.js` component
   - Form collects basic info (name, email, password) and initial preferences
   - Data is sent to `POST /api/users` endpoint
   - `userController.createUser()` validates data and creates a new user in MongoDB
   - Password is hashed before storage for security

2. **Login Process**:
   - Users login via the `LoginScreen.js` component
   - Credentials are sent to a login endpoint
   - Server validates credentials and returns a JWT token
   - Token is stored in the app's secure storage
   - User data is loaded into the `AuthContext` for global access

3. **Profile Management**:
   - Users can view and edit their profile via the `ProfileScreen.js`
   - Changes are sent to `PUT /api/users/:id` endpoint
   - `userController.updateUser()` updates the user document in MongoDB

### User Preferences

User preferences are collected and stored for personalization:

1. **Initial Preferences**:
   - Collected during registration (travel style, budget, interests)
   - Stored in the User model in MongoDB

2. **Continuous Feedback**:
   - Collected via the `FeedbackPopup.js` component
   - Randomly selects questions about preferences
   - Updates the user profile via `PUT /api/users/:id`
   - Triggers itinerary regeneration when preferences change significantly

3. **Preference Schema**:
   ```javascript
   {
     travelStyle: String,        // "adventurous", "relaxed", "balanced"
     budget: {
       min: Number,
       max: Number
     },
     interests: [String],        // ["hiking", "museums", "food", etc.]
     dietaryRestrictions: [String], // ["vegetarian", "gluten-free", etc.]
     accessibility: [String],    // ["wheelchair", "limited-mobility", etc.]
     preferredTransportation: String, // "walking", "public", "car"
     feedbackResponses: [{
       question: String,
       response: String,
       timestamp: Date
     }]
   }
   ```

## 3. Dynamic Itinerary Generation

The AI personalization module combines multiple data sources to generate personalized itineraries:

### Data Sources

1. **User Profile**:
   - Preferences stored in the User model
   - Historical feedback and responses

2. **External APIs**:
   - Weather data via `weatherAPI.js`
   - Local events via `eventsAPI.js`

3. **Real-time Feedback**:
   - Continuous input from the `FeedbackPopup.js`
   - Mood, current interests, and spontaneity level

### Generation Process

The `generateDynamicItinerary()` function in `aiPersonalization.js` orchestrates the generation process:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieves user profile and preferences
   - Fetches current weather for the location
   - Gets local events happening during the trip dates

2. **Preference Processing**:
   - Analyzes recent feedback to adjust preferences
   - Weighs historical preferences against recent changes
   - Considers time of day and weather conditions

3. **Activity Selection**:
   - Filters activities based on weather (indoor vs. outdoor)
   - Matches activities to user interests
   - Balances cost against budget constraints
   - Ensures accessibility requirements are met

4. **Itinerary Structure**:
   - Creates a day-by-day schedule with morning, afternoon, and evening activities
   - Includes travel time between locations
   - Adds meal suggestions based on dietary preferences
   - Calculates estimated costs for budgeting

5. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Responds to weather changes in real-time
   - Adapts to user feedback throughout the day
   - Suggests alternatives when reservations aren't available

### Itinerary Schema

```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  location: {
    city: String,
    country: String,
    coordinates: {
      latitude: Number,
      longitude: Number
    }
  },
  days: [{
    date: Date,
    weatherForecast: {
      condition: String,
      temperature: Number,
      precipitation: Number
    },
    activities: [{
      time: String,
      title: String,
      description: String,
      location: {
        name: String,
        address: String,
        coordinates: {
          latitude: Number,
          longitude: Number
        }
      },
      category: String,
      cost: Number,
      reservationStatus: String,
      reservationDetails: {
        id: String,
        provider: String,
        confirmed: Boolean
      }
    }]
  }],
  totalCost: Number,
  notes: String,
  isCollaborative: Boolean,
  collaborators: [ObjectId]
}
```

## 4. Reservation System

The reservation system integrates with external APIs and includes an AI-based fallback mechanism:

### Primary Reservation Process

1. **Reservation Request**:
   - User selects an activity to reserve in the app
   - Request is sent to `POST /api/itineraries/:id/reserve` endpoint
   - `itineraryController.reserveActivity()` handles the request

2. **External API Integration**:
   - System attempts to book through services like OpenTable or Viator
   - Simulated in the current implementation with a 60% success rate
   - On success, returns confirmation details

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - If external APIs fail, `autoReservationFallback()` from `reservationAI.js` is triggered
   - Analyzes reservation details (activity type, time, location, preferences)
   - Simulates an AI-based decision process to secure alternative reservations
   - Returns a confirmation with a unique reservation ID

4. **Reservation Storage**:
   - Reservation details are stored with the activity in the itinerary
   - Status is updated in real-time (pending, confirmed, failed)
   - Users receive notifications about reservation status changes

### Fallback Algorithm

The `autoReservationFallback()` function simulates an AI-based reservation system:

1. Analyzes the activity details and user preferences
2. Determines the likelihood of securing a reservation (simulated with 85% success rate)
3. Generates a unique reservation ID for tracking
4. Returns a confirmation object with success status and details

This provides a seamless experience even when primary reservation channels are unavailable.

## 5. Collaborative Itinerary Planning

The collaborative planning feature allows two users to create a joint itinerary:

### User Invitation Process

1. **Invitation**:
   - User selects "Plan Together" on the `HomeScreen.js`
   - Navigates to `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js`
   - Enters email of another user or selects from contacts
   - System sends an invitation notification

2. **Preference Merging**:
   - When both users are connected, the system merges their preferences
   - Common interests are prioritized
   - Conflicting preferences are balanced (e.g., budget, travel style)
   - Accessibility needs from both users are respected

3. **Joint Itinerary Generation**:
   - System calls `POST /api/itineraries/generate/collaborative` with merged preferences
   - Backend generates an itinerary that satisfies both users
   - Activities are marked with suitability indicators for each user

4. **Confirmation and Sharing**:
   - Both users review the proposed itinerary
   - Either can suggest modifications
   - Once confirmed, the itinerary is saved to both user profiles
   - Both receive notifications about updates and reservations

### Preference Merging Algorithm

The preference merging logic:

1. Finds the intersection of activity interests
2. Takes the union of dietary restrictions and accessibility needs
3. Averages budget ranges (with adjustments for significant differences)
4. Balances travel styles (e.g., if one user is adventurous and the other relaxed, selects "balanced")
5. Preserves individual preferences for personal activities

## 6. Real-time Updates & Notifications

The app includes comprehensive real-time updates and push notifications:

### Push Notification System

The `notifications.js` utility provides:

1. **Notification Types**:
   - Welcome notifications when the app starts
   - Preference update notifications after feedback
   - Itinerary update notifications (weather changes, event cancellations)
   - Reservation status notifications
   - Collaborative planning notifications

2. **Scheduling Options**:
   - Immediate notifications
   - Scheduled notifications for future events
   - Recurring notifications for daily updates

3. **Deep Linking**:
   - Notifications include data for navigation
   - Tapping a notification opens the relevant screen
   - Context parameters are passed for a seamless experience

### Real-time Updates

The app implements several real-time update mechanisms:

1. **Future Itinerary Planning**:
   - `FutureItineraryScreen.js` allows selecting future dates
   - Displays tentative plans for dates beyond 7 days
   - Shows detailed itineraries for closer dates
   - Implements polling to refresh data at varying frequencies:
     - Every 30 minutes for dates within 24 hours
     - Every few hours for dates within a week
     - Daily for dates beyond a week

2. **Weather-based Updates**:
   - Monitors weather forecasts for planned dates
   - Automatically suggests alternative activities when weather changes
   - Sends notifications about significant weather changes

3. **Event Updates**:
   - Tracks local events included in itineraries
   - Updates if events are cancelled or rescheduled
   - Suggests alternatives when events become unavailable

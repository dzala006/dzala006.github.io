# Resolution for PR Merge Conflicts

## Issue

Several PRs (#5, #8, #10, and #11) are having merge conflicts because they are trying to create files that already exist in the repository with more advanced functionality.

## Existing Files

The following files already exist in the repository with the correct implementations:

1. `personalized-adventure-backend/controllers/itineraryController.js` - Already includes the `reserveActivity` function with proper integration of the `autoReservationFallback` function from `reservationAI.js`.

2. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/screens/HomeScreen.js` - Already includes the FeedbackPopup integration and notification system.

3. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/screens/CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` - Already includes the collaborative itinerary planning functionality with notification integration.

4. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/utils/notifications.js` - Already includes all the necessary functions for scheduling, canceling, and managing notifications.

## Solution

The best approach is to close the conflicting PRs and continue with the existing codebase, which already has all the required functionality.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. Close PR #5 (Enhance Reservation Functionality with AI Fallback System) - The functionality already exists in `itineraryController.js`.

2. Close PR #8 (Update HomeScreen with FeedbackPopup Integration) - The integration already exists in `HomeScreen.js`.

3. Close PR #10 (Add CollaborativeItineraryScreen for Joint Adventure Planning) - The screen already exists with all required functionality.

4. Close PR #11 (Add Push Notifications System) - The notification system is already implemented in `notifications.js` and integrated with the other components.

## Verification

I've verified that all the required functionality exists in the current codebase:

- The `itineraryController.js` file includes the `reserveActivity` function that uses the `autoReservationFallback` function from `reservationAI.js`.
- The `HomeScreen.js` file includes the FeedbackPopup integration and uses the notification system.
- The `CollaborativeItineraryScreen.js` file includes the collaborative itinerary planning functionality and uses the notification system.
- The `notifications.js` file includes all the necessary functions for scheduling, canceling, and managing notifications.

## Next Steps

After closing the conflicting PRs, you can continue with any other PRs that depend on these features, as they are already available in the codebase.

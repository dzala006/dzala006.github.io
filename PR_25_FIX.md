# Fix for PR #25 - TensorFlow.js Integration

## Issue

PR #25 is trying to add TensorFlow.js integration to the Personalized Adventure App, but it's failing to merge because the necessary files already exist in the repository:

1. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/utils/tensorflowSetup.js`
2. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/utils/aiPersonalizationHelpers.js`
3. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/utils/aiPersonalizationRuleBased.js`
4. `PersonalizedAdventureApp/src/utils/aiPersonalization.js`

## Solution

The TensorFlow.js integration is already implemented in the codebase. The existing implementation includes:

1. A TensorFlow.js model loading and initialization system
2. Data preprocessing for model input
3. Model inference with proper tensor cleanup
4. Post-processing of model output into structured itineraries
5. A rule-based fallback system when the ML model fails

## How to Use TensorFlow.js in the App

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native expo-gl expo-file-system
   ```

2. The App.js file already initializes TensorFlow.js when the app starts:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     const setupTensorFlow = async () => {
       try {
         const isInitialized = await initializeModel();
         console.log('TensorFlow.js initialization status:', isInitialized);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error initializing TensorFlow.js:', error);
       }
     };
     
     setupTensorFlow();
   }, []);
   ```

3. The `generateDynamicItinerary` function in `aiPersonalization.js` already uses TensorFlow.js for generating personalized itineraries.

## Conclusion

PR #25 can be closed as the functionality it's trying to add already exists in the codebase. The TensorFlow.js integration is fully implemented and ready to use.
